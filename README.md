Unlocking Financial Insights in Banking Data

# **Introduction**

Financial institutions operate in a data-intensive environment where understanding customer behavior, risk assessment, and transaction patterns is crucial. As a data analyst at FinInsight Group, a consultancy specializing in banking analytics, the primary objective is to extract actionable insights from banking datasets. This project involves analyzing two comprehensive datasets: 'Banking Transactions' and 'Customer Account Details.' Leveraging Power BI, the study focuses on identifying trends, relationships, and financial patterns that impact banking operations.
